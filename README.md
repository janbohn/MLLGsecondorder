# MLLGsecondorder
This is a second order in time and first order in space FEM BEM coupling for the MLLG system. Further details can be found in my thesis https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000133728

just run errorplottime.py or errorplotspace.py for a experimental order of convergence experiment either in time or in space.
